## Visual Identity

### Color Palette

**Primary Colors**

Our primary palette reflects the intersection of technology (purple/blue) and industrial strength (deep slate):

- **Ivy Purple** `#8b5cf6` - Primary brand color representing AI innovation and premium positioning

### Typography

**Primary Typeface: Inter**

Inter is our primary typeface for all digital communications. Its exceptional readability at small sizes makes it ideal for email campaigns, while its modern geometric construction conveys technical precision.

- **Headings**: Inter Bold (700), 24-32px, letter-spacing -0.02em
- **Subheadings**: Inter SemiBold (600), 18-20px
- **Body Text**: Inter Regular (400), 16px, line-height 1.6
- **Captions**: Inter Medium (500), 14px, color: Text Gray

**Fallback Stack**: `'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif`

### Logo Usage

**Primary Logo**: The Ivy.AI wordmark features a stylized "Ivy" in Ivy Purple with ".AI" in Industrial Slate. The logo includes a subtle geometric pattern suggesting interconnected nodes, representing our agent orchestration capabilities.

**Logo Variations**:
- **Full Color on White**: Primary usage for email headers, website
- **White on Dark**: For dark backgrounds, footers
- **Icon Only**: Simplified "I" mark for favicons, social media avatars
- **Monochrome**: Industrial Slate version for print, single-color applications

**Clear Space**: Maintain clear space equal to the height of the ".AI" suffix on all sides of the logo.

**Minimum Size**: Never reproduce the logo smaller than 120px width in digital applications.

## Brand Voice & Messaging

### Tone of Voice

Our communication style adapts to context while maintaining core principles:

**In Email Subject Lines**: Direct, benefit-focused, occasionally using urgency or curiosity. Example: "Reduce CNC Downtime by 40% with Predictive Maintenance AI"

**In Email Body Copy**: Professional yet conversational, technical when necessary but always accessible. We use industry terminology correctly but explain AI concepts in manufacturing terms our audience understands.

**In CTAs**: Action-oriented, specific about next steps, emphasizing value over features. Example: "See Your ROI Calculator" instead of "Learn More"

### Messaging Pillars

Every Ivy.AI communication should reinforce one or more of these core messages:

**Proven ROI**: We lead with numbers. Our clients see average ROI of 485%, conversion rates of 8.1%, and revenue increases of $2.8M+ per campaign. These aren't projections—they're results from manufacturers like FAGOR.

**Manufacturing Expertise**: Our AI agents aren't generic chatbots. They understand CNC operations, maintenance schedules, parts lifecycles, and the technical language of industrial equipment. This expertise translates to higher engagement and conversion.

**Effortless Scalability**: What used to require a team of technical sales engineers now runs automatically. Our clients scale from 50 to 5,000 customer interactions without adding headcount, while maintaining personalized, expert-level conversations.

**Trusted Partnership**: We integrate seamlessly with existing systems (CRM, ERP, email platforms) and provide dedicated support. Our clients view Ivy.AI as an extension of their team, not another software vendor.

## Email Campaign Framework

### Email Structure Standards

Every Ivy.AI marketing email follows this proven structure:

**Header Section** (60-80px height): Ivy.AI logo (left-aligned), subtle gradient background (Ivy Purple to Tech Blue), optional navigation links for multi-touch campaigns.

**Hero Section** (300-400px): Compelling headline (28-36px, Industrial Slate), supporting subheadline (18px, Text Gray), hero image or illustration (if applicable), primary CTA button (Ivy Purple background, white text, 16px padding).

**Body Content** (variable): 2-4 content blocks with clear hierarchy, each block addressing one key benefit or pain point, supporting statistics or social proof, secondary CTAs as text links.

**Social Proof Section**: Customer logo bar (grayscale logos, 40px height), testimonial quote (if space permits), trust indicators (industry certifications, security badges).

**Footer Section** (120-150px): Company address, contact information, social media links (LinkedIn, Twitter), unsubscribe link (required), privacy policy link.

### Responsive Design Requirements

All email templates must render correctly on:
- **Desktop** (600px+ width): Full layout with sidebar content if applicable
- **Mobile** (320-600px width): Single column, stacked content, touch-friendly CTAs (minimum 44px height)
- **Dark Mode**: Provide alternative color scheme for dark mode email clients

### Accessibility Standards

- Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text
- Alt text for all images describing content and context
- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- CTA buttons with descriptive text (avoid "Click Here")

## Campaign-Specific Guidelines

### CNC Training Campaign

**Target Persona**: Plant Managers, Production Supervisors seeking to upskill operators

**Key Messaging**: Position training as investment in productivity, not cost. Emphasize reduced downtime, fewer errors, faster ROI on new equipment.

**Visual Style**: Use images of modern CNC equipment, operators in clean manufacturing environments. Avoid dated industrial imagery.

**Proof Points**: "92% of trained operators reduce setup time by 30 minutes per job" | "Training ROI achieved in 4.2 months on average"

### Warranty Extension Campaign

**Target Persona**: Maintenance Directors, CFOs evaluating total cost of ownership

**Key Messaging**: Frame warranty as risk mitigation and budget predictability. Emphasize cost of unexpected downtime vs. known warranty investment.

**Visual Style**: Before/after scenarios, cost comparison charts, timeline graphics showing coverage periods.

**Proof Points**: "Average unplanned downtime costs $22,000 per hour" | "Extended warranty customers experience 68% fewer production interruptions"

### Equipment Repair Campaign

**Target Persona**: Maintenance Managers facing urgent repair needs or evaluating repair vs. replace decisions

**Key Messaging**: Speed, expertise, and cost-effectiveness. Highlight fast response times, OEM-certified technicians, transparent pricing.

**Visual Style**: Technical diagrams, repair process timelines, before/after equipment condition photos.

**Proof Points**: "Average 24-hour response time" | "15% lower cost than OEM direct service" | "98.5% first-time fix rate"

### Maintenance Plans Campaign

**Target Persona**: Operations Directors, Plant Managers looking to move from reactive to predictive maintenance

**Key Messaging**: Transition from fighting fires to preventing them. Emphasize total cost savings, extended equipment life, reduced emergency repairs.

**Visual Style**: Predictive maintenance dashboards, equipment health scores, cost savings graphs.

**Proof Points**: "Reduce emergency repairs by 73%" | "Extend equipment life 5-7 years" | "Average $180K annual savings per facility"

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Best Practices

**Lead with Benefits, Not Features**: Instead of "Our AI uses natural language processing," write "Your customers get instant answers to technical questions, 24/7."

**Use Specific Numbers**: Replace vague claims with concrete data. "Increase efficiency" becomes "Reduce response time from 4 hours to 4 minutes."

**Speak Manufacturing Language**: Use industry terms correctly. Reference specific equipment (Haas VF-2, Mazak Integrex), processes (5-axis machining, EDM), and standards (ISO 9001, AS9100).

**Address Pain Points Directly**: Our audience faces real challenges. Acknowledge them: "Your maintenance team is stretched thin. Parts lead times are unpredictable. Customers expect instant responses."

**Provide Clear Next Steps**: Every email should have one primary CTA and make the next action obvious. Avoid multiple competing CTAs.

### Subject Line Formulas

**Benefit-Driven**: "[Specific Result] for [Target Audience]" → "40% Faster Quote Turnaround for CNC Job Shops"

**Curiosity + Relevance**: "[Intriguing Statement] + [Industry Context]" → "The Maintenance Strategy 73% of Manufacturers Are Adopting"

**Social Proof**: "[Company Type] Achieves [Result]" → "Mid-Size Manufacturer Cuts Support Costs $240K with AI"

**Urgency + Value**: "[Time-Sensitive Offer] + [Clear Benefit]" → "Last Week: Lock In 2025 Training Rates (Save 18%)"

**Question Format**: "[Relevant Challenge Question]" → "Still Manually Following Up on Every Quote?"

### Call-to-Action Best Practices

**Primary CTAs** should be:
- **Specific**: "Calculate Your ROI" not "Learn More"
- **Action-Oriented**: Start with verbs (Get, See, Calculate, Schedule, Download)
- **Value-Focused**: Communicate what they'll receive (Your Custom Demo, Free Assessment, ROI Report)

**Button Design**: Ivy Purple background, white text, 16px vertical padding, 32px horizontal padding, 6px border radius, subtle shadow on hover.

**Placement**: Primary CTA in hero section (above fold), repeated at end of email, secondary CTAs as text links within body content.
