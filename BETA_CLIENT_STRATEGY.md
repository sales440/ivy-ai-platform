### **4. Cold Email Outreach (Scalable, Lower Conversion)**

**How to Find Emails:**
- Hunter.io (find emails by company domain)
- Apollo.io (B2B database with filters)
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator + email finder extension

**Email Template (3-Email Sequence):**

**Email 1: The Hook**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s lead qualification process

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is hiring SDRs (saw the posting on LinkedIn) - congrats on the growth!

Quick question: How are you currently handling lead qualification for your growing sales team? Most companies at your stage struggle with SDRs spending 60%+ of their time on unqualified leads.

I built an AI agent (Ivy-Prospect) that auto-scores leads 0-100 and routes hot leads directly to your closers. Early users cut qualification time by 40%.

Would a 15-min demo be helpful? Here's a 3-min video overview: [link]

Best,
[Your Name]
Founder, Ivy.AI
```

**Email 2: Social Proof (3 days later if no response)**
```
Subject: Re: Quick question about [Company]'s lead qualification process

Hi [Name],

Following up on my email from Tuesday. Wanted to share a quick update:

We just onboarded [Beta Client Name], a B2B SaaS company similar to [Company], and they're seeing 30% more qualified leads in their first week using Ivy-Prospect.

Still offering 60 days free access to 2 more beta companies this month. Interested in a quick call?

Video demo: [link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 3: Breakup Email (5 days later if no response)**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I'll take your silence as a "not interested right now" and close your file.

Before I do - is there a better time to revisit this? Or should I reach out to someone else on your team who handles sales operations?

Either way, here's the demo video in case you want to bookmark it for later: [link]

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you reply "not interested", I'll never bug you again. Promise!
```

**Success Rate:** 2-5% (typical cold email rates)

## 💬 Common Objections & Responses

### **Objection 1: "We already have a CRM/support tool"**
**Response:** "Great! Ivy.AI integrates with your existing tools. Think of it as an AI layer on top of your CRM that does the manual work your team currently does. We're not replacing your CRM, we're making your team 10x more productive."

### **Objection 2: "We're too small/too big for this"**
**Response:** "Actually, [10-50 employees] is our sweet spot. You're large enough to have real pain around manual processes, but small enough to be agile and see results fast. Our beta clients are exactly your size."

### **Objection 3: "How is this different from ChatGPT?"**
**Response:** "ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot. Ivy.AI has 6 specialized agents trained for specific business functions - sales, support, operations, HR, strategy. They work together in workflows and integrate with your existing tools. It's like having 6 AI employees vs. 1 chatbot."

### **Objection 4: "We don't have budget right now"**
**Response:** "That's why this is perfect timing - the beta program is 100% free for 60 days. No credit card, no commitment. You get to test it risk-free, and if you love it, we can talk about paid plans after the beta. If not, no hard feelings."

### **Objection 5: "I need to talk to my team first"**
**Response:** "Absolutely! Here's what I recommend: take this 3-min demo video [link], share it with your team, and let's schedule a group call next week where I can answer everyone's questions. Sound good?"

### **Objection 6: "Can you customize it for our industry?"**
**Response:** "Yes, but let's start with the standard product first. 80% of what you need is already built. Once you're using it for 2 weeks, we can discuss custom features based on your specific needs. That way we're customizing based on real usage, not guesses."

## 🚀 Quick Win: The "Referral Loop"

Once you sign your first beta client, ask them:

> "Who else do you know in [industry] who struggles with [pain point]? I'd love to offer them the same beta deal you got. Would you be comfortable making an intro?"

**Why This Works:**
- Warm intros convert 5x better than cold outreach
- Your beta client becomes an advocate
- You get pre-qualified leads (similar company profile)

**Incentive (Optional):**
- "For every referral that becomes a beta client, I'll extend your free access by 30 days"
- Or: "Refer 3 companies and get lifetime 50% discount"
